# rust-practice

This repository is a personal playground for learning Rust.

I use this repo to experiment with different Rust concepts, libraries, and problem domains as I learn the language more deeply. Each folder is a separate crate or mini-project focused on a specific topic.

Nothing here is meant to be “perfect” or production-ready, the goal is understanding, practice, and iteration. I will update some projects as I go on

### What you’ll find here
- Small Rust crates instead of one big project
- Experiments with different parts of the ecosystem
- Code written while learning, breaking things, and fixing them

### Projects made (so far, will grow overtime)
- cli-todo (A simple todo app built using clap, and serde-json for persistent storage)
